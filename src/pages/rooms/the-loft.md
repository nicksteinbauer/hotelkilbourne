Other amenities include a luxurious White Dove mattress, plush linens, flat screen HDTV, Fireplace, oversized private shower, Molton Brown Bath products, Nespresso machines and high-speed WIFI.

Steps away from Moseley’s rooftop bar, guests can enjoy the public space or grab a drink and take it back to The Loft and enjoy the private city view terrace.
