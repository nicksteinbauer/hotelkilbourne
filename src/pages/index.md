Issue 2 would unnecessarily change our current cohesive government structure into political fiefdoms.  Our current at-large City government system is working and change simply doesn’t make sense.

In 2020, the Charter Review Committee studied Sandusky’s government structure.

The Committee, made up of a cross-section of residents, business, and civic leaders, invited experts to testify about possible structural changes. The Commission studied and carefully deliberated proposed changes.  The Commission voted 11-2 against structural change. 

A small group of proponents were not happy with that decision and now are working to overturn the informed, thorough and transparent decision-making of the Charter Review Committee. 

Issue 2 would overturn the decisions of a deliberative, open, and transparent process and is driven by certain candidacies for city commission seats. 

Don’t be fooled.  The current structure is working and Sandusky is making great progress. 

Dividing Sandusky into wards would create unnecessary chaos, fiefdoms, and acrimony. 

Sandusky is revitalizing throughout the city, including our neighborhoods, our schools, our roads, housing, and infrastructure.  Keep that progress going by defeating the politically-motivated Issue 2.

Don’t divide Sandusky.  Together, Sandusky is moving forward.
