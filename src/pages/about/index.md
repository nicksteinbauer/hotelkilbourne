Hotel Kilbourne, detailed in a classic elegance with a modern flair, is a loud and lively nine room boutique hotel overlooking Sandusky Bay. All of beautiful Historic Downtown Sandusky, Ohio is walkable from our location. From festivals, events, shows, or just a night out in the city, we have the perfect location in the heart of the Entertainment District.

We are more than just a boutique hotel.  Inside you will discover Oh Taco, an Authentic Mexican Restaurant and Tequila Bar, very well known for their margaritas. Then be sure to head to the top floor and sip a handcrafted cocktail, frozen drink, or grab a beer at Moseley’s Rooftop Bar.  All while enjoying a view of the Cedar Point Skyline, Jackson Street Pier, boats on the bay, and more! We also feature Dandelion, a very unique boutique gift store, focused on small, local, independent and fair trade merchandise. 

You can Eat, Drink, Shop, and Sleep all right here!
