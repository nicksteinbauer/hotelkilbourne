Whether you’re  staying in a stunning lake view, beautiful city view, or The Loft, you can be sure your room will include luxury bedding and towels, mini fridge, complimentary water, HD TV, free high-speed internet, make-up wipes, hair dryer, earplugs, iron and mini ironing board.  Every room also includes snacks, sodas and spirits for purchase.

Each room is furnished with an elite White Dove Mattress.  White Dove is a family-owned business based in Cleveland, Ohio since 1922.  

For a kickstart anytime during your stay, an espresso is just a button away…  

Each room is equipped with a Citiz Nespresso machine and selection of sustainable coffees.

Hotel Kilbourne proudly stocks Molton Brown London products.  Every room is stocked with shampoo, conditioner, body wash, soap, lotion, mouthwash and a vanity kit.  In case you forget something, one of our friendly front desk agents will be happy to help with a toothbrush, toothpaste, shaving kit, mending kit, nail file or polishing mitt.

"Finding Molton Brown in your hotel bathroom is the mark of a fine property.”\
